# iptoasn

Maps IP addresses to AS information using
[Team Cymru's API](http://www.team-cymru.org/IP-ASN-mapping.html)

## Usage

This package only makes ose of the DNS API.

```golang
import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/thomas-maurice/iptoasn/iptoasn"
    "os"
    "encoding/json"
)

func main() {
    // You have to specify which DNS resolver you want to use
	client := iptoasn.NewIPToASNResolver("8.8.8.8:53")
	ipinfo, err := client.GetAddressInfo("74.125.195.94")

    if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("Could not get IP information: %s", err))
		os.Exit(1)
	}

    b, err := json.Marshal(ipinfo)

    fmt.Println(string(b))
}
```

The above code would return something like
```json
{
    "as_number": 15169,
    "network": "74.125.195.0/24",
    "country_code": "US",
    "as_name": "GOOGLE - Google Inc.",
    "as_country_code": "US"
}
```
